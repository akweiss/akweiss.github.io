Here's some of the projects I've done on GitHub.

<h2>
Computational Fluid Dynamics
</h2>

<img src="2DiffLoop.gif" />

The above is an animation of linear convection in two dimensions. Mathematically, the governing PDE is: \(\int cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C\).

This is just one step of a project that involved multiple steps leading up to the Navier-Stokes equations. The link to the full project can be found at the top of this page.

<h2>
RNA Sequencing
</h2>

Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq techniques using multiple command line softwares. Data was analyzed and findings were visualized in R. Studied the differential expression between the human X chromosome gene expression in males and females.

Full project can be found in the links at the top of this page.

<p>

Inline formula \(\int_a^bx^2 dx \). Displayed formula: \[ \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}=\infty \]

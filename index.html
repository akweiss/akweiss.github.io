Here's some of the projects I've done on GitHub.
<br>

<h2>
Computational Fluid Dynamics
</h2>

The above is an animation of linear convection in two dimensions. Mathematically, the governing PDE is: 
\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0\).

<br>
This is just one step of a project that involved multiple steps leading up to the Navier-Stokes equations. 
The link to the full project can be found at the top of this page.

<h2>
RNA Sequencing
</h2>

Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq techniques using multiple command line softwares. Data was analyzed and findings were visualized in R. 
Studied the differential expression between the human X chromosome gene expression in males and females. <br>

Full project can be found in the links at the top of this page.

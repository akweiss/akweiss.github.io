Here's some of the projects I've done on GitHub.

### Computational Fluid Dynamics

The above is an animation of linear convection in two dimensions. Mathematically, the governing PDE is: \(x^2\)

This is just one step of a project that involved multiple steps leading up to the Navier-Stokes equations. The link to the full project can be found [here](https://github.com/akweiss/cfd-simulations).

### RNA Sequencing

Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq techniques using multiple command line softwares. Data was analyzed and findings were visualized in R. Studied the differential expression between the human X chromosome gene expression in males and females.

Full project can be found [here](https://github.com/akweiss/RNA-seq-intro).

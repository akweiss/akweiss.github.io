Here's some of the projects I've done on GitHub.

### Computational Fluid Dynamics

The above is an animation of linear convection in two dimensions. Mathematically, the governing PDE is:
$$x^2$$

This is just one step of a project that involved multiple steps leading up to the Navier-Stokes equations. The link to the full project can be found [here](https://github.com/akweiss/cfd-simulations).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/akweiss/akweiss.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
